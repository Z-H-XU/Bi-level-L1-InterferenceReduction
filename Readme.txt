Thank you very much for your attention to our work!

In the experiments for the simulated radar data,  read radar data for interference reduction using Bi-lelve L1 Optimization.

Main_Simulation.m : simualtion of interference reduction for range and velocity measurments;

Main_RealRadarData.m : real radar data of interference reduction for range and velocity measurments;

Main_RealRadarMIMOdata.m : real radar data of interference reduction for angle measurments;

If you use the code, please kindly cite the following paper:  Zhihuo Xu: Bi-level L1 Optimization Based Interference Reduction for Millimeter Radars. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Under 2nd review.

Thank youÔºÅ
